# CM108AH Configuration Tool

A Python tool for accessing the CM108AH external configuration EEPROM via the ASIC's custom HID endpoint.

## System requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Windows OS (limitation due to PyWinUSB.HID library)

## Installation

1. Create a new virtual environment using:

        python -m venv .venv

2. Activate the virtual environment

        .\.venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Before running this tool, activate the Python virtual environment using:

    .\.venv\Scripts\activate

The tool uses a YAML configuration file to create and download an EEPROM image to the device. A blank configuration template is provided in [`config_template.yaml`](config_template.yaml). The proposed configuration for fiberaudio-108 boards is provided in [`fiberaudio-108.yaml`](fiberaudio-108.yaml).

To display a help message, use:

    python .\cm108ah.py -h

To list all available Cmedia devices, use: (**Note: Not all listed devices may support EEPROM features**)

    python .\cm108ah.py list

To program a configuration from an existing file into the device, use:

    python .\cm108ah.py program <filename>

Each mode command now supports fields for custom Vendor-ID, Product-ID and device index:

    python .\cm108ah.py read --vid 0d8c --pid 013c --device 1

**Retry programming, if the verification step fails.** After programming, the device needs to be power cycled, in order to apply the new configuration.

The tool offers additional options for erasing and reading the configuration EEPROM. See the help message for details.
